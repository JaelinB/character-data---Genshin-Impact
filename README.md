# character-data---Genshin-Impact

#    Program that reads over files and filters out information \n
#    basde on the input given by the user
#
#    The first part of the program initializes the constants
#
#    After the constants are made, the menu, user inputs, and header \n
#    / format variables are made
#
#    The next part of the program defines the functions needed to \n
#    make the program work. The key functions would be the open and read file \n
#
#    Once the functions are made, the program goes into the main function
#
#    The main function is where the user enters an input from 1 to 4 and \n
#    the program
#    gives information based on the option entered
#    
#    If the user enters an invalid input, an error message will appear and \n
#    a reprompt 
#
#    If the user enters 4, the program will close
#
#    The program will always reprompt the user for another option after the \n
#    information is given
